            <p> Make a lot of tea, and its mostly that come in those little discardable satchels. After some time drinking tea you end up figuring out that the best tea usually doesnt come in satchels. It comes a granel.The problem with that is that it's a pain in the ass compared to the satchels. </p>
            <p> With a satchel you put the hot water in a cup, time it and you have your tea. You can bring the cup with you wherever you may be going.</p>
            <div class="img-div">
                <img src=imgs/greyA.png>
                <figcaption>Tremendous image, the singleness of the gray reflects the conflict in not taking a white and black morality.</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p> You can also to that with free leaves, assuming you with to eat them alongside your tea, or drink it through clenched teeth. Otherwise you have to engage in the whole tea ritual. Which in certain situations can be very intersting. But for a quick tea fix is not exactly optimal.</p>
            <p> Which ends up leaving me drinking not so good tea in spite of having good ones in stock. To fix that you can make your own satchels, but thats alot of work. And its one more thing to worry about.</p>
            <p> In this horrible desolation of first world problewms enters the mesh flail of tea. The mesh flail is a little hollow ball on a chain where you put tea and after closing it, you ahve your own portable good quality tea.</p>
            <p> That is a very welcome optimization. It makes things faster, its easier, require less devices. But whats most intersitng about that is what it tells about optimizations. Its not just about makes things faster or more pleasurable to use. It of course, doest that. But the magic is that little optimzation, that increase in speed and patricicity, changes how you behave completely. Gone are te days of bad quality tea, there's no reason for them to exist anymore. The inneficiency in the process that gave way for their existence is gone. A little more speed or praticicity changed an entire pattern of behavior. (I buy more tea then ever, and different kinds of tea.) Which in of itself gave me a great deal of distributed pleasure from tasting different teas that i've come to like very much.</p>

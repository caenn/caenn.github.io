   - [X] how do blogs display their stuff
     - you can just show the blogs in sequence
     - tiles seems the most reasonable balance in terms of being able to choose what you want to read
       - could do some netflix style shit in the displaying of the tiles (thats veeery intersting)
     - a little description below the title might be intersting
     - only images do provide some sense of mystique
     - colorscheme?
     - just text can work too, probably less well on mobile
